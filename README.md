# Grandmaster Recall

Guess the chess opening from an animated move sequence. Built with Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and React.

## Stack
- Next.js 14, TypeScript, App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- framer-motion, lucide-react, react-chessboard, chess.js, canvas-confetti

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the dev server: `npm run dev` (opens on http://localhost:3000)
3. Type-check/lint: `npm run lint`
4. Production build: `npm run build` then `npm start`

All app code lives in `app/`, shared UI in `components/`, and game data/logic in `data/` and `utils/`.
